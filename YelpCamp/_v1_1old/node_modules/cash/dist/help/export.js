This is the same as the\nbehavior if `-p' is given.\n\nOtherwise, the variable is exported to the environment. If the variable has\nalready been defined in the environment (ex. `PATH'), then this will either\nredefine its value or do nothing (if no value is passed in). If the variable is\nnot already in the environment, it will be added with the `VALUE' given\n(defaults to the empty string).\n\n  -p           print all exported variables in a reusable format\n      --help   display this help and exit\n\nReport export bugs to <https://github.com/dthree/cash>\nCash home page: <http://cash.js.org/>\n";
